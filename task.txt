To implement the new properties for configuring dark mode in the IDV Web SDK, follow this detailed implementation plan. The plan breaks down the tasks into manageable steps necessary to complete the feature from start to finish.  ### Step-by-Step Implementation Plan:  #### Step 1: Update the SdkConfig Object Model - **Task 1.1**: Add New Properties   - Add  as a property of the  object model.   - Add  as a property of the  object model.    - **Task 1.2**: Modify Builders   - Update the builder class for  to include methods for setting these two new properties. Make sure methods are chainable to maintain current builder pattern consistency.  #### Step 2: Implement Helper Methods - **Task 2.1**: Create Helper Methods for    - **Method 2.1.1**: Implement a helper method  that sets the  to ON.   - **Method 2.1.2**: Implement a helper method  that sets the  to OFF.   - **Method 2.1.3**: Implement a helper method  that sets the  to AUTO.  #### Step 3: Modify JSON Serialization - **Task 3.1**: Update JSON Serialization Logic   - Ensure that  and  are only included in the JSON payload if they are set by the Relying Business.  #### Step 4: Testing - **Task 4.1**: Unit Testing   - Write tests for the new properties to ensure they are correctly set and serialized.   - Test each helper method to ensure they set the  appropriately in the  object.  - **Task 4.2**: Integration Testing   - Run integration tests to confirm that the entire IDV session creation process works smoothly with the new properties configured.    #### Step 5: Documentation - **Task 5.1**: Update Documentation   - Update any relevant developer guides or inline documentation to include instructions on configuring  and .   - Document the new helper methods for easier developer comprehension.  #### Step 6: Code Review and Deployment - **Task 6.1**: Peer Code Review   - Submit the code for review to ensure quality and adherence to project standards.  - **Task 6.2**: Prepare for Deployment   - Merge into the main branch if all tests pass and the code review is successful.   - Follow the deployment process to deliver the updated SDK to Relying Businesses.  This implementation plan outlines the necessary steps to integrate and support the new dark mode configuration, ensuring a smooth development process and compliance with existing system architecture.
