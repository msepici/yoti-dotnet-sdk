To implement the new properties for configuring dark mode in the IDV Web SDK, I will follow these steps. Let’s start with updating the `SdkConfig` object model.

### Plan

1. **Update SdkConfig Object Model**
   - Add new properties: `darkModeEnabled` and `darkModeAuto`.
   - Modify builders for these properties.
2. **Implement Helper Methods**
   - Method to set dark mode to ON.
   - Method to set dark mode to OFF.
   - Method to set dark mode to AUTO.
3. **Modify JSON Serialization**
   - Ensure properties are included only if set by the Relying Business.
4. **Testing**
   - Write unit tests for new properties.
   - Test helper methods for correct functionality.
5. **Documentation**
   - Update developer guides and inline documentation.
6. **Code Review and Deployment**
   - Peer code review and merge if successful.
   - Follow deployment process.

I will begin by updating the `SdkConfig` object model. Let's proceed with that.

I found the relevant files to update for the `SdkConfig` object model. We'll focus on two main files to begin with:

- `src/Yoti.Auth/DocScan/Session/Create/SdkConfig.cs`: This file defines the `SdkConfig` class.
- `src/Yoti.Auth/DocScan/Session/Create/SdkConfigBuilder.cs`: This is where we can add the builder methods.

Let's start by adding the new properties `darkModeEnabled` and `darkModeAuto` to the `SdkConfig` class.

Let's start by reading specific sections directly to finalize this update manually.

**Step-by-Step Update:**

1. **Add Properties to `SdkConfig`:**
   - Add the properties `DarkModeEnabled` and `DarkModeAuto` to the class.
   
2. **Modify Constructor in `SdkConfig`:**
   - Update the constructor to include these new properties.

3. **Update `SdkConfigBuilder`:**
   - Add private fields `_darkModeEnabled` and `_darkModeAuto`.
   - Add methods `WithDarkModeEnabled` and `WithDarkModeAuto`.
   
I'll proceed with these updates one by one. Let's start with reading the files accurately to then apply changes.
